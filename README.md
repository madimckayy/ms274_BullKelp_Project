Overview

This Jupyter notebook serves as the final project submission for Madison McKay in the MS 274 course. The notebook is focused on analyzing average winter sea surface temperature (SST) data, average winter chlorophyll a (chl-a) data, and their correlation with the fall bull kelp canopy area.

Code structure and usage:
-Import the required modules.
-Download SST and chlorophyll-a data using the provided scripts.
-Define the study area grid and extract relevant data.
-Create seasonal average time series for SST and chlorophyll-a.
-(Optional) Convert SST from Kelvin to Celsius.
-Save the time series data as CSV files.
-Import kelp canopy area CSV 
-Plot time series of SST, chlorophyll-a, and bull kelp canopy area.
-Perform correlations and multiple linear regression
-Visualize the results.

Notes
Ensure that the necessary data files and dependencies are available before running the notebook.
Adjust paths and parameters as needed for your specific setup.
Feel free to reach out to the author, Madison McKay, for any questions or clarifications related to this notebook.
